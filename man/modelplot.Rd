\usage{
modelplot(
  models,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  coef_map = NULL,
  coef_omit = NULL,
  facet = FALSE,
  draw = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{a single model object or a (potentially named) list of models
to summarize}

\item{conf_level}{confidence level to use for confidence intervals}

\item{coef_map}{named character vector. Names refer to the original variable
names. Values refer to the variable names that will appear in the table.
Coefficients which are omitted from this vector will be omitted from the
table. The table will be ordered in the same order as this vector.}

\item{coef_omit}{string regular expression. Omits all matching coefficients
from the table (using `stringr::str_detect`).}

\item{facet}{TRUE or FALSE. When the 'models' argument includes several
model objects, TRUE draws terms in separate facets, and FALSE draws terms
side-by-side (dodged).}

\item{draw}{TRUE returns a 'ggplot2' object, FALSE returns the data.frame
used to draw the plot.}

\item{...}{all other arguments are passed to the `tidy` method used to
extract estimates from the model. For example, this allows users to set
`exponentiate=TRUE` to exponentiate logistic regression coefficients.}
