\usage{
gtsummary(models, statistic = "std.error", conf_level = 0.95,
  coef_map = NULL, coef_omit = NULL, gof_map = NULL,
  gof_omit = NULL, fmt = "\%.3f", stars = NULL, title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL, notes = NULL, filename = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{a single model object or a (potentially named) list of models
to summarize}

\item{statistic}{string name of the statistic to include in parentheses
below estimates. Must be either "conf.int", or one of the column names
produced by the `broom::tidy` function. Typical values include: "std.error",
"conf.int", "statistic", "p.value".}

\item{conf_level}{confidence level to use for confidence intervals}

\item{coef_map}{named character vector. Names refer to the original variable
names. Values refer to the variable names that will appear in the table.
Coefficients which are omitted from this vector will be omitted from the
table. The table will be ordered in the same order as this vector.}

\item{coef_omit}{string regular expression. Omits all matching coefficients
from the table (using `stringr::str_detect`).}

\item{gof_map}{data.frame in the same format as `gtsummary::gof_map`}

\item{gof_omit}{string regular expression. Omits all matching gof statistics from
the table (using `stringr::str_detect`).}

\item{fmt}{string which specifies how numeric values will be rounded. This
string is passed to the `sprintf` function. '\%.3f' will keep 3 digits after
the decimal point with trailing zero. '\%.5f' will keep 5 digits. '\%.3e' will
use exponential notation. See `?sprintf` for more options.}

\item{stars}{NULL for no significance stars. TRUE for default significance
stars (*=.1, **=.05, ***=.01). Named numeric vector for custom significance
stars: c('*' = .1, '+' = .05).}

\item{title}{string}

\item{subtitle}{string}

\item{notes}{list of notes to append to the bottom of the table.}

\item{filename}{if not NULL, the table will be written to file. The file
format is infered from the file extension. Valid extensions include: .html,
.rtf, .tex.}

# load data and estimate models
data(trees)
models <- list()
models[['Bivariate']] <- lm(Girth ~ Height, data = trees)
models[['Multivariate']] <- lm(Girth ~ Height + Volume, data = trees)

# simple table
gtsummary(models)

# confidence intervals, p values, or t-stats instead of standard errors
gtsummary(models, statistic = 'conf.int', conf_level = 0.99)
gtsummary(models, statistic = 'p.value', conf_level = 0.99)
gtsummary(models, statistic = 'statistic', conf_level = 0.99)

# rename and re-order coefficients
gtsummary(models, coef_map = c('Volume' = 'Large', 'Height' = 'Tall'))

# save to file (html, rtf, or LaTeX)
gtsummary(models, filename = 'table.html')
gtsummary(models, filename = 'table.rtf')
gtsummary(models, filename = 'table.tex')

# titles and subtitles
gtsummary(models, title = 'This is the title', subtitle = 'And a subtitle')

# title with italicized text
gtsummary(models, title = gt::md('This is *the* title'))

# notes at the bottom of the table (here, the second note includes markdown bold characters)
gtsummary(models, notes = list('A first note', gt::md('A **bold** note'))
