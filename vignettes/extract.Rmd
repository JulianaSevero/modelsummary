title: "Raw data"
---

Power users may want to export raw data from `modelsummary` for further post-processing before creating their tables. They can achieve that by setting the `output` argument to `data.frame`:

```{r}
library(modelsummary)
mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp, mtcars)
modelsummary(mod, output="data.frame")
```
